    We briefly introduced
    <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/index.html"
        target="_blank">the Swift programming language</a>, and how you can learn it. You should definitely try it out before Apple annouces
    this year's WWDC Scholarship (which give you a chance to talk to Apple CEO and etc.) We'll definitely be talking about
    machine learning and artificial intelligence in the next meeting. Also,
