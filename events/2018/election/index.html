    <h1>2018-2019 CS Club Officer Positions For Election</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <details>
                <summary>2 Vice Presidents</summary>

                Vice presidents, please help the president improving the community and implementing new ideas.
            </details>
        </li>
        <li>
            <details>
                <summary>1 Treasure</summary>

                Treasure, we need to have enough funds for our activities, but it doesn’t mean that people who don’t pay the dues/donations
                are not part of the community.
            </details>
        </li>
        <li>
            <details>
                <summary>1 Secretary</summary>

                Secretary, I suggests you to keep the attendance, meeting recaps, and assist the other officers.
            </details>
        </li>
        <li>
            <details>
                <summary>1 Public Relationships & Marketing</summary>

                Public & Mark, do you still remember the flyers we have around the school? Our morning announcements, emails, facebook posts,
                discord chats, etc.?
            </details>
        </li>
        <li>
            <details>
                <summary>1 Webmaster</summary>

                Webmaster, we need a better website than the one we have right now. Look at this page… And we need https.
            </details>
        </li>
        <li>
            Any other positions that you think we should have.

        </li>
    </ul>

    Just to make it clear, supporting the other officers is not only the Secretary's job.
    <br>
    <br>And you are welcome to campaign for the president, as long as the computer science club will be a friendly and welcoming
    community for all.
    <br>
    <br> For the last and very interesting position, results will be determined by the current officers through internal selection.
    The rest of the above positions will be elected. However, I, the current Vice President Troy, and Mr. Lau reserve the
    right to make the final decision.
    <br>
    <br> To be elected, we suggest you prepare a 3-minute speech or anything that demonstrates that you are qualified as an officer
    of the CS club. However, you cannot attack any other candidates. We don’t want another
    <i>Eric v. Dhruv</i> case 2 years ago, if you know what that is.
    <br>
    <br> - Apollo, 2017-2018 Oakton CS Club President
